# This is a timer-based quiz application: 

  * Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.

  * When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials.
